Memoria
~~~~~~~

A clone of the popular `card game`_, known as Pairs, Concentration, Memory or others. 

- it uses photos from a folder you specify
- can be played alone, against the computer or another human player
- if played alone, uses a scoring system
- if the mouse hovers over turned-over cards, they increase in size, making it possible to see the photos on small screens or when a big amount of cards are used

To compile the game, open and build it with `QtCreator`_.
